This file, dojo-example.profile.js file, and dojo-example-build.sh are the *only* files modified
from the source distribution of Dojo. What this means is there should be no
other modifications to this source tree!  Everything under
dojo-release-1.10.2-src is stock Dojo.  If you modify this tree, members of the
FCO team are coming for you with torches and pitchforks.

Custom file list:

dojo-release-1.10.2-src/util/buildscripts/dojo-example-build.sh
